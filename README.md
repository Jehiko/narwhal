# narwhal

These scripts provide example code as a companion to "Strange attractor of a narwhal (Monodon monoceros)" (2022) by Evgeny A. Podolskiy,  Mads Peter Heide-JÃ¸rgensen on bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.26.493667

The scripts were based on off-the-shelf Matlab functions and the freely available time-embedding-related scripts, as well as violin and polar plotting routines by H. Yang, J. Dorn and D.C. Hanselman, respectively, from https:// 287 www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange, files 58246, 23661, and 38855.

Scripts were executed in Matlab 2018b and 2021b (https:// mathworks.com 283 /products/matlab.html). Please note that 2018b abd 2021b may differently deal with line transparency, therefore we suggest 2018b.
