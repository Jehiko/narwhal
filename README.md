# narwhal and chaos

These scripts provide code used for analysis, plots, and videos - as a companion to "Strange attractor of a narwhal (Monodon monoceros)" (2022) by Evgeny A. Podolskiy,  Mads Peter Heide-Jørgensen on bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.26.493667

All depth measurements are freely available online [at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6522945]. Sea-ice concentration was retrieved from NOAA scientific data depository (AVHRR Pathfinder Version 5.3 L3-Collated, Global, 0.0417◦, 1981-present, Daytime, 1 Day Composite) freely available at https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/griddap/ nceiPH53sstd1day.graph.

The scripts were based on off-the-shelf Matlab functions and the freely available time-embedding-related scripts, as well as violin and polar plotting routines by H. Yang, J. Dorn and D.C. Hanselman, respectively, from https://  www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange, files 58246, 23661, and 38855.

Scripts were executed in Matlab 2018b and 2021b (https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). Please note that 2018b and 2021b may differently deal with transparency of scatter3 points (MarkerEdgeAlpha = 0.01), therefore, we suggest 2018b.
